# Rolly

A simple Discord roll call bot for our Arma 3 unit.

Rolly takes in reacts from members and colours their cells in a Google Sheets spreadsheet to represent attendance.

## Why make this?
Our Arma 3 unit takes roll call for weekly operations through a channel in Discord and manually updates a Google Sheets spreadsheet with attendees.
I thought '[Why do it yourself when robots do it better?](https://youtu.be/byAZmFIJ1OM?t=11)' and so Rolly was born.
